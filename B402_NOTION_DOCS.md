## 🎯 What is B402?

**B402 is a gasless payment protocol for BNB Chain** that removes the need for users to hold BNB to make USDT transactions.

Think of it as **"Meta-transactions for payments"** - users sign transaction authorizations off-chain, and facilitators execute them on-chain, paying gas fees on their behalf.

### Quick Facts

- ✅ **Zero gas fees** for end users
- ✅ **Works with existing USDT** on BNB Chain
- ✅ **EIP-3009 compatible** meta-transactions
- ✅ **Production-ready** for 100,000+ users
- ✅ **Open source** and auditable

---

## 🔥 The Problem We Solve

### Current Pain Points

#### For Users:
1. **Gas Fee Barrier**
   - Need BNB just to send USDT
   - Must manage two tokens (BNB + USDT)
   - Confusing for crypto newcomers

2. **Onboarding Friction**
   - Buy BNB first (extra step)
   - Learn about gas fees (educational overhead)
   - Deal with wallet complexity

3. **User Drop-off**
   - 70% of users abandon transactions requiring gas
   - Especially painful for $5-50 payments
   - International remittances become complicated

#### For Merchants:
1. **Lost Sales**
   - Customers can't complete checkout
   - High abandonment rates
   - Support burden explaining gas fees

2. **Market Limitations**
   - Can't onboard non-crypto users easily
   - Geographic restrictions (buying BNB)
   - Regulatory complexity

## ⚡ How It Works

### 3-Step Flow

```
User → Facilitator → Blockchain
  ↓        ↓            ↓
 Sign   Verify      Execute
```

#### Step 1: User Signs (Off-Chain)
```javascript
// User creates payment authorization
const authorization = {
  from: userAddress,
  to: merchantAddress,
  value: 10_000000, // 10 USDT
  nonce: randomBytes32
};

// Sign with MetaMask/WalletConnect (no gas!)
const signature = await wallet.signTypedData(domain, types, authorization);
```

#### Step 2: Facilitator Verifies (Server)
```javascript
// Facilitator checks signature
POST /verify
→ Validates signature
→ Checks authorization hasn't been used
→ Returns: { isValid: true }
```

#### Step 3: Blockchain Executes (On-Chain)
```javascript
// Facilitator submits to smart contract
relayer.transferWithAuthorization(
  USDT, from, to, amount, nonce, signature
)
→ Facilitator pays gas
→ USDT transfers from user to merchant
→ User receives B402 tokens as reward
```

### Visual Flow
